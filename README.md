## **Why XOR?**

The XOR (exclusive OR) problem demonstrates the need for neural networks to model non-linear relationships, making it a classic milestone for understanding artificial intelligence.

---

## **Technical Details**

- **Frontend**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **3D Visualizations**: Powered by WebGL for seamless rendering of interactive graphics.
- **Neural Network Implementation**: Features custom backpropagation and activation functions coded from scratch.

## **How to Use**

1. Open the website on a **laptop or desktop** (WebGL is not supported on mobile devices).
2. Adjust parameters like learning rate, epochs, and more using the provided controls.
3. Watch the network learn and visualize how it tackles the XOR problem in both 2D and 3D.
